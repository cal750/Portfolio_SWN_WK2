                        Hey! My name is Seth Nightingale and I am an aspiring
                        Programmer, Web Developer and Computer Technician. That sounds like a lot because
                        it is, and I strive to be as experienced in my chosen fields as I can be.
                    </p>

                    <p class= "paragraph">
                        I have always had an interest in IT and Computer building, having completed
                        four years of Mechatronics and Computer Programming in school.
                    </p>

                        I don't have the widest variety of things I enjoy. The obvious ones
                        are playing video games and not going outside, but I also have an interest
                        in building PCs and Technology related subjects, even such things as taking
                        apart things to find out how they work.

                        I just wanted to share my puppy. His name is Fudge and you needed to see him
                        some more.
